# C Programming bootstrap

Anyone wanting to understand and do systems programming must know C.  You might use other languages, but it is important to understand the lowest-level programming language (aside from assembly).

# Resources

Feel free to update this with any resources you find.

- See Essential C at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/.
- See Pointers and Memory, and Lists and trees at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/.
- See http://shah7.com/c.pdf for an excessively indepth guide on C. The original!

What resources have you found?  Post them in this repo!

# Projects

- See https://github.com/gparmer/c_object_models_instructional for examples of different types of object orientation implemented in C.
- See https://github.com/gparmer/tlr for a simple bitcode implementation in C for a language.  The "Tiny Language Runtime".

TODO: fork these projects into the GW-SHC.

# Practice

- I'll post a set of data-structure assignments here from OS soon.
- See clist.h, cvect.h, cringbuf.h and bitmap.h in Composite at https://github.com/gparmer/Composite/tree/master/src/components/include.  These have a set of unit tests at https://github.com/gparmer/Composite/tree/master/src/platform/tests, so you can see their use.
